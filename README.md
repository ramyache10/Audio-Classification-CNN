# 🔊 Audio Classification with Deep Learning

Welcome to this project on **Audio Classification**, where we explore the power of deep learning in analyzing and classifying audio signals. This project walks through data preprocessing, feature extraction, model development, and evaluation using real-world audio datasets.

> 🎯 **Goal:** Classify different types of audio samples (e.g., speech, music, environmental sounds) using CNN-based models.
